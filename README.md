# About ShiverBot
This is a Splatoon 3 memory tinkerer that connects to a Nintendo Switch console that has sys-botbase running.

**Previous to version 1.2.0 of the game, this tool allowed to cheat money and ability chunks. Because of the recent banwave associated with these acts, these features have been removed from the tool. Advice for anyone who is still looking to find ways to cheat: don't.**

Features:
- Search for your gear's RNG seed (only view, NOT change)
- Post printer

_Past features (removed due to banwave):_
- ~~Edit money~~
- ~~Edit ability chunks~~
- ~~Edit food and drink tickets.~~
- ~~Cheat in tableturf against AI.~~


# Read this
There is no longer a ban risk associated with ShiverBot because cheating and memory editing features were removed. They won't be coming back.

Before version 1.2.0 of the game, the tool allowed to edit money, ability chunks, tickets and tableturf matches.
We [thought] ability chunks and money had a minimum risk. The recent banwave proved us wrong.

# Preparations
- You need to have a Nintendo Switch console running Atmosphere CFW.
- Get sys-botbase [from here](https://github.com/olliz0r/sys-botbase/releases/latest). You just need the .zip. Extract the contents in the root of your SD card.
- Delete any active Splatoon 3 cheats files you may have in atmosphere/contents/... in your SD card. This is a very important step or sys-botbase won't be able to read memory.
- Do not run Edizon homebrew or anything else that makes modifications to the RAM (having the overlay is fine, just don't have any cheat files for the game).

# Tutorial
1. Enter your Nintendo Switch IP and click connect.

# Troubleshooting
- If you can't open the program because you're missing frameworks for .NET, [download and install this](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/...u/runtime-desktop-6.0.9-windows-x64-installer).
- Make sure you're running the game in English (US or EU). Other languages are known to have differences in memory addresses.
- If you can't connect to sys-botbase, follow this [external guide](https://github.com/kwsch/SysBot.NET/wiki/Troubleshooting-Connection-Errors) for advice.
